# The Tegmark & Zaldarriaga Figure

In their [2002 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0207047), Max Tegmark and Mattias Zaldarriaga developed a method for compressing the information from several different types of cosmological probes into constraints on the power spectrum of matter fluctuations in the universe. In doing so, they created one of the iconic figures in cosmology, summarizing information from a range of vastly different observations and showing these were all consistent with the predicitions from the simple Î›CDM model of cosmology. 

This repository provides a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) written in the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language which recreates this figure for modern data. The notebook, along with all dependencies pre-installed, are available as a "binder" on [https://mybinder.org/](https://mybinder.org/), and you are one-click away from launching it:

The aim of this repository is to maintain a reproducible, readable, and easily modifiable code for producing this important and useful figure. Contributions are very welcome!


Other ways to run this notebook:

* Clone this repository, then build and run the Dockerfile youself. 

* Clone this repository, install the necessary dependences (see the Dockerfile for info on what needs to be installed) and run Jupyter notebook yourself.
